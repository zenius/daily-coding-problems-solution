This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.

Solution: 
        const debounce = function(fn, delay = 300) { 
            let timer; 
            return function() { 
                let context = this, 
                args = arguments; 

                clearTimeout(timer); 

                timer = setTimeout(()=> { 
                    fn.apply(this, arguments); 
                }, delay); 
            }
        };
